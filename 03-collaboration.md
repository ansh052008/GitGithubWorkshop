# Collaboration / Workflow Exercises

- [ ] Merge conflicts with a neighbor
- [ ] Fork this presentation repo
- [ ] Make a pull request


Maybe fork & clone, edit-commit-push, and pull-request?
Maybe online pull request?
Maybe add collaborators to a test repo and everyone goes to town?
Maybe somewhere in this repo ppl can do PR's?
Do we worry about merge conflicts or no?

# Pre-Workshop Setup

Prior to the workshop, please try to get your machine set up with the following things:

-[ ] Get a Github account
-[ ] Install or update Git
-[ ] Verify Git installation and introduce yourself to Git
-[ ] Prove Git can talk to Github
-[ ] Cache your username and password
-[ ] If you use RStudio (or other Git-aware IDE), check it can find Git

These steps are from the pre-workshop instructions from Jenny Bryan's [happy-git-with-R](http://happygitwithr.com/workshops). Her guide has useful advice for many of these steps.

### Get a Github Account

Github is a cloud service for sharing and collaborating on code. Basically: Sharepoint for code. It is based on Git for version control, but just as Sharepoint is not Office, Github (the cloud service) is distinct from Git (the version control software). You can read EPA's current guidance for Github on the [EPA intranet](https://www.epa.gov/webguide/github-guidance).

You can register a Github account yourself at https://www.github.com. 

While most things about your account can be changed later, Jenny Bryan suggests thinking a little bit about [picking your username](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#github-acct). 

A Github account can be associated with multiple email addresses. The EPA Github Guidance states that EPA employees should [create a new account associated with their EPA email address](https://www.epa.gov/webguide/github-guidance#who) when contributing to a repository associated with the EPA organization. However, Github recommends that users have only [one account for both personal and professional repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-multiple-user-accounts/).


### Install or Update Git

3) Check that you can find Git from the command line (try out Git-Bash maybe)
4) Introduce yourself to Git
4) Try out Git-GUI
5) If you use RStudio (or another Git-aware editor), connect RStudio and Git

Try out some of the basic exercises (new repo on GH, clone repo, edit-commit-push)

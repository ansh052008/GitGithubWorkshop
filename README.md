Git has myriad features which -- though extremely powerful -- can be very confusing (especially for those of us who last used a command line in the 1980s). The goal here is to give you just enough experience to start using Git day-to-day. Then you can explore more advanced corners of Git as you need them. We also tried to include enough here that if you have the basics down you may still find something to challenge yourself.


## Pre-Workshop Setup

**Please** take some time prior to the workshop to get some pre-requisites in place. It will be much more challenging to participate in the workshop if you don't have the necessary software. In particular, you need:

1) A Github account
2) Install Git
3) Know where to find your command line

Head on over to the [setup file](01-setup.md) to get the details.


## Shoulders of Giants

One of the biggest reasons to use Git is to access, re-use, and contribute to open source code. True to this goal, these materials seek to re-use material out there from our favorite existing tutorials. We either link out or adapt with minor additional EPA-specific or windows-specific commentary.

We are particularly indebted to Jenny Bryan's [Happy-Git-with-R](http://happygitwithr.com/) book and materials
    
For more advanced tasks the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book, by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is a good source.


## Outline

1) [Pre-Workshop Setup and Installation](01-setup.md)
2) [Practice: pull, edit, commit, push (and repeat)](02-practice.md)
3) [Collaboration workflows](03-collaboration.md)
4) [Exporing repo history](04-history.md)
5) [Git automation](05-automation.md)

In the ideal world, all the pre-workshop setup can be accomplished prior to the session. Then during the hands-on part of the workshop people can choose where to spend their time. I imagine those new to Git might just work on #2, while more advanced users might find something of interest in the other sections. We wanted to make sure no one would be bored.

# Automation

(this is far beyond what we expect people to actually reach in the tutorial, but want to make sure to include nuggets for the already-experienced Git users)

- [ ] Enable travis on a repo
- [ ] Hooks, (e.g., a bash/python/R script triggered by a Git action)
- [ ] Github pages

We cannot yet use continuous integration services with repos in the USEPA Github organization, but you can test out the process with a personal repo.

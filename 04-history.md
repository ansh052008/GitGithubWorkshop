# Repo History

One benefit of version control is the ability to trace back the history of changes in your code. In this section we will try out a couple of options for exploring repository history.

- [ ] Inspect repo history on Github
- [ ] Inspect repo history with Git-GUI and gitk
- [ ] Git history: diffs, blames, branches
- [ ] LICENSE.md, Contributor guidelines


## Expore Repo History on Github

Choose an existing repo with some history. It could be [this repository](https://github.com/jameelalsalam/GitGithubWorkshop) or maybe the Github repository for a Python or R package that you have used in the past. Maybe: 

* [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) or 
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)

The repository page has tons of information. You can explore the current code, see what bugs have been reported in the code, and what changes have been suggested by the community.

Since the README file is used as teh home page for a repo on Github, this is frequently the place to go to learn about a piece of software you haven't used before.

### Code

Navigate into a code folder and open up a code file. 

SCREENSHOT - folder

SCREENSHOT - file

Explore the Raw, Blame, and History views -- what are they showing?

SCREENSHOT -- views


### Issues

What changes have people requested to the code? From the repository home, go to the `issues` tab.

SCREENSHOT



### Pull requests

You will start on the `code` tab, but there are other tabs for `issues` (bug reports and feature requests), `pull requests` (proposed code changes from the user community).


Then all the folders


## Explore Repo History with Git-GUI

### Clone an existing repo locally






### Open the Repo in Git-GUI

TODO: add screenshot from Git-GUI opening a repo


### Inspect Commit Graph

TODO: add screenshot from Git-GUI/gitk


## Git History: diffs, blames, branches

It is possible to explore diffs, blames, branches, commits, etc, all from the command line. I have to admit I don't have much experience with this, but you could try out:

TODO: find a link to recommend.


## Extras: LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DESCRIPTION, etc
